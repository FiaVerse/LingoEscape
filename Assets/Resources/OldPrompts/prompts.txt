**Step 1: Choose a French Dicton/Popular Saying and Create the Puzzle Core (Reasoning First)**
- **Choose one short, well-known, and grammatically correct A1-level French popular saying or "dicton" (idiomatic expression).** This saying should naturally lend itself to being broken into two logical parts and can be associated with physical objects (prefabs) from the provided list, even if the association is metaphorical.
    * **Examples of the type of sayings to consider:** "Bonne nuit" (Good night), "Merci beaucoup" (Thank you very much), "Tourner en rond" (To run in circles), "Mettre la main sur" (To get a hold of something).
    * **Prioritize sayings that contain words or concepts that can be directly and easily associated with the names of the available `Prefabs`.** For example, if the saying contains "book," strongly prefer the "book" prefab. If it contains "bed," strongly prefer the "bed" prefab.
- **Break the chosen saying into two logical, pedagogically sound parts.** These parts should be learnable chunks for an A1 learner.
- **For each of these two parts, infer the primary concept(s) (e.g., the noun, verb, or common association) directly from the text of the part.**
- **Based on these inferred concepts, and relying heavily on the *name* of the prefab (the last part of its path, e.g., "cat" from "Prefabs/cat"), intelligently select two unique `Prefabs` from the provided `Prefabs` data that best represent or are strongly associated with those concepts.**
- **Crucially, the `prefab` value in your JSON output MUST be the exact key/path from the `Prefabs` data (e.g., "Prefabs/moon").**

---

**Step 2: Invent a Theme and Design the Puzzle (Based on Core)**
- **Based directly on the `selected_phrase` (the chosen dicton/saying) and the two `Prefabs` chosen in Step 1, invent a simple, one-sentence theme or scenario for the player.** This theme should logically connect the phrase and the objects. For example, if "Bonne nuit" and "Bed" are chosen, the theme could be about a bedroom.
- **Design a simple, interactive puzzle concept** that leverages the meaning of the chosen phrase and the two selected prefabs. The puzzle should reflect the phrase's meaning and common interactions with the chosen prefabs. For instance, if the phrase implies "X is in Y," the puzzle could involve placing prefab X into prefab Y, or finding prefab X located within prefab Y.

**Step 3: Generate Content in French**
- Create a `narrative_intro` which is the theme you invented, written as a short, spoken introduction for the player. This MUST be in simple, A1-level French.
- For each puzzle part, create an `instruction` and an `audio_prompt` (max 10 words each). These must also be in A1-level French and fit the theme and the designed puzzle concept.
- Create a `final_prompt` (max 10 words) in A1-level French.

**Step 4: Format the Output**
Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object.

Your JSON output must follow this exact structure:
{
    "narrative_intro": string,
    "selected_phrase": string,
    "puzzle_concept_description": string, // Describe the high-level interaction of the puzzle
    "puzzle_parts": [
        {
            "word": string, // The French text of this part of the phrase
            "prefab": string, // The prefab path (e.g., "Prefabs/cat")
            "instruction": string, // A1 French instruction for this part
            "audio_prompt": string // A1 French audio prompt for this part
        },
        {
            "word": string,
            "prefab": string,
            "instruction": string,
            "audio_prompt": string
        }
    ],
    "final_prompt": string,
    "expected_answer": string, // The full selected_phrase in French
    "selection_reasoning": { // Explain the AI's intelligent choices
        "phrase_choice": string, // This will now describe why it chose this particular dicton/saying
        "prefab_associations": [
            {"phrase_part_text": string, "inferred_concept": string, "selected_prefab_path": string, "reason": string},
            {"phrase_part_text": string, "inferred_concept": string, "selected_prefab_path": string, "reason": string}
        ]
    }
}

OLD PROMPT 

You are a creative game designer for a French language-learning escape room (Level A1). Your task is to create a mini, one-puzzle scenario.

**Step 1: Invent a Theme**
First, invent a simple, one-sentence theme or scenario for the player. For example, "The player is in a Parisian bakery and must find the key to the pantry."

**Step 2: Create the Puzzle**
Based on your theme, perform the following steps:
- Choose one short French phrase (A1 level) from the list below.
- Break it into two logical parts.
- Assign each part to a unique prefab from the provided list.

**Step 3: Generate Content in French**
- Create a `narrative_intro` which is the theme you invented, written as a short, spoken introduction for the player. This MUST be in simple, A1-level French.
- For each puzzle part, create an `instruction` and an `audio_prompt` (max 10 words each). These must also be in A1-level French and fit the theme.
- Create a `final_prompt` (max 10 words) in A1-level French.

**Step 4: Format the Output**
Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object.

Your JSON output must follow this exact structure:
{{""narrative_intro"":string, ""selected_phrase"":string, ""puzzle_parts"": [{{""word"":string, ""prefab"":string, ""instruction"":string, ""audio_prompt"":string}}], ""final_prompt"":string, ""expected_answer"":string}}

**Input Data:**
Phrases: {0}
Prefabs: {1}
