You are a creative game designer for a {language}-language learning escape room (Level {level}). Your task is to create a mini, one-puzzle scenario.

ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT RULES â€“ ZERO TOLERANCE

1. Do NOT invent prefab paths.  
2. "expected_answer" must exactly equal "selected_phrase".  
3. Do not reuse any phrase that appeared before.  
4. All output text must be in simple {language}.  
5. If the phrase cannot be split into exactly {word_count} meaningful prefab-friendly parts, abandon it and choose another.

---

**Puzzle-length rule**  
Return **exactly {word_count} objects** in `"puzzle_parts"`:  
A1â†’2, A2â†’3, B1â†’4, B2+â†’5.  
Ignore filler words (articles, prepositions).

---

**Step 1 â€“ Choose a {language} expression**  
â€¢ Must be CEFR level {level}.  
â€¢ Must map cleanly to {word_count} prefab paths.  

**Step 2 â€“ Map to Prefabs**  
â€¢ Use ONLY the prefab paths in *Input Data*.  
â€¢ No invented or altered paths.  

**Step 3 â€“ Design the Puzzle**  
â€¢ narrative_intro â‰¤ 10 words.  
â€¢ Each instruction â‰¤ 6 words, phrased as a riddle/question.  
â€¢ audio_prompt = a short hint in {language}.
â€¢ final_prompt â‰¤ 10 words.  
â€¢ victory_message â‰¤ 8 words (congratulations).  

**Step 4 â€“ Output one JSON object**

{
  "narrative_intro": string,
  "selected_phrase": string,
  "puzzle_concept_description": string,
  "puzzle_parts": [   // EXACT length = {word_count}
    { "word": string, "prefab": string, "instruction": string, "audio_prompt": string }
    â€¦ repeat until {word_count} entries â€¦
  ],
  "final_prompt": string,
  "expected_answer": string,
  "victory_message": string,
  "selection_reasoning": { â€¦ }
}

Input Data:  
{0}

Reminder:  
â€¢ Any invalid prefab, wrong part count, English text, or phrase repeat â†’ reject output.
